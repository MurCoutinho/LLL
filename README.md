# LLL

Implementation of the Lenstra, Lenstra and Lovasz (LLL) algorithm using Rust. It can be used to reduce a Lattice basis and to try to solve the SVP problem.
This code is based on Alg 2.6.3 from Henri Cohen - A Course in Computational Algebraic Number Theory.

Disclaimer: This implementation was designed for educational purposes. This is not a competitive implementation of LLL. Please look at https://github.com/fplll/fplll for a more professional implementation of LLL and other algorithms.
